Some small easy console programs which may turn out to be beneficial for starters of batch programming. I've included both `.bat` and `.exe` files and they're free to use, implement etc. <br>
I wish some may find it interesting and get help from this. ^__^  <br> 

And also anyone can help to make it large by making exciting programs in batch programming and add that here. That would be very helpful for all.
